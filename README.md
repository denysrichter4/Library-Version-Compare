# Library Version Compare Plugin

## üìñ Overview
The **Library Version Compare Plugin** is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin designed to help developers compare different versions of a library. It provides an intuitive interface to identify differences between two versions of a library, making it easier to track changes and ensure compatibility.

## ‚ú® Features

- **File Difference Scanner**: Detect changes in files between the selected versions.
- **Clear Results**: Quickly clear the comparison results with a single action.
- **Persistent Settings**: Automatically save and reuse repository paths and tags for future comparisons.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple dialogs and lists to display results and manage comparisons.

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Open the Plugin**: Access the plugin through the IntelliJ IDEA toolbar or menu.
2. **Set Parameters**: Enter the repository path, adapted path, and the tags for the old and new versions.
3. **Run Comparison**: The plugin scans the differences between the selected versions and displays the results.
4. **View Results**: See the list of changed files and their details.
5. **Clear Results**: Use the "Clear" action to reset the list for a new comparison.
